This page is far from finished, don't trust anything you can read here yet.
Consider this my opinion, not as fact. I'm just writing down ideas so I can see progress.

# There be dragons

Your Web Browser comes with all sorts of useful features, some of them require connections to Internet Servers. On this page, you will learn about some of the essential Services most Browsers offer, and the data you (potentially) share with third parties when using them.

For more information on what this means, why you should care and what to to about it, read the FAQ below.

### Why?

I got the inspiration for this page when one day, I captured my Network Traffic and opened my Web Browser (Firefox)... As it turns out, there is quite a lot going on in your network when you open a new browser session! But it wasn't always like this. New functions of the "Web 2.0", that I do indeed like and use a lot, just require you to communicate with Servers on the Internet. Nothing special here, that's what the Web was made for.

But my Browser never prompted me to ask if I really want to enable these features, it never asked which Servers it should use. Browser Manufacturers made that decision for me, they set up and run the Servers needed for Notifications and Connectivity Tests, and configured my Browser to use their services without asking.

As a programmer and full-time nerd, I'm not OK with that. And I can't imagine anyone who doesn't have a job in IT knowing - or even caring - about that. That's why I made this page.

### How bad is the situation?

You'll live. But we've seen enough data leaks to know that even Internet Giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc. can't guarantee to keep their Users' data safe [citation needed].

So why should we keep feeding them our data?

### Why should I care?

It's your data. You own it.

### How awesome, all those services are provided to me for FREE?

No, Browser Manufacturers don't provide those services for free. They are companies, they have to generate revenue in order to exist. There's no such thing as a FREE service. You always pay, one way or another, most often with your data.

Millions of People use them every day, can you imagine how much it costs to run all of the infrastructure for this? Do you think Browser Manufacturers just pay it out of their own pocket? Don't they have an incentive to monetize your usage of their software and services? Why shouldn't they process and sell the data you send them?

Even if your data isn't processed and/or sold to anyone who is willing to pay... There is no such thing as perfect security[citation needed], it's only a matter of time until the next big data leak.

### What can I do?

A lot. Depending on your knowledge and how much time you want to invest, you can:

- Deactivate all those services and never use them again... But that would totally suck.
- Use Incognito mode to browse. Easy and fast, but doesn't solve all problems and doesn't offer all features of normal browsing mode.
- Run your own servers! It will cost you some money (like 5 bucks a month), and at this point in time, an awful lot of hard work and knowledge is needed to do that.
- Trust your Browser Manufacturers that they don't do evil things with your data and keep it 100% secure.

Obviously, having your own server running the services that Browser Manufacturers provide for you would be the best solution to stay in control of your data. That's why I want to make this option as easy to use as possible. If you love Privacy and have knowledge about Browsers, Linux, Python or Docker, please consider contributing to **PROJECT TBA**.

### Any famous last words?

A huge thank you goes out to all Browser Manufacturers for giving us this awesome software in the first place. Without them, I wouldn't be writing this and you wouldn't be reading this. But we can do better, and if I won't do it, who else will?

I don't want to bash on any of the Browsers mentioned above, but I've been around for long enough (FF version 2) to know that where there's big data, there will be privacy breaches. The only way to prevent this is to not collect all of our data in one single place. Spread it out, make it hard to get. In other words: Decentralize the Internet!
